Valentine Web Prompt

What this is
- A tiny, cute webpage to ask someone "Will you be my Valentine?"
- Built with AngularJS (1.8) for a small, framework-driven demo without CLI overhead.
- The `No` button avoids clicks and after 3 attempts it auto-accepts.

Files
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styling
- `script.js` — AngularJS controller and behavior

Run locally
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or serve it).

Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Create a repo (e.g., `valentine`) and push these files to the `main` branch.
2. In the repo Settings → Pages, set the source to the `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder.
3. Save and wait a minute; your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>`.

Want a modern Angular version?
- I can scaffold a full Angular CLI project if you want a production-ready app (requires Node.js & Angular CLI).
